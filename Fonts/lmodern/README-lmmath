The Latin Modern Math (LM Math) fonts completes the modernization of the
Computer Modern family of typefaces designed and programmed by Donald E.
Knuth.

That modernization started with the provision of the Latin Modern (LM)
family of text fonts in the modern OpenType format and with a far richer
set of diacritics and other glyphs making it suitable for typesetting of
most Latin scripts.

However, the modernization was incomplete without the math fonts of the
Comupter Modern family which were one of the main reasons for the
widespread use of the Computer Modern fonts, most notably to typeset
papers containing mathematical formulas.

LM and LM Math taken together may now be regarded as a full descendant
of Computer Modern.

The LM Math fonts may be freely downloaded from:

Please note that the LM Math fonts might be used for typesetting
mathematics with MS Office 2007 and newer.

The Latin Modern Math fonts are licensed under the GUST Font License
(GFL), which is a free license, legally equivalent to the LaTeX Project
