Description: Digital typography system written in OCaml
 Patoline is a digital typography system, similar to TeX or Microsoft Word, but
 using an up-to-date language and algorithm, and leveraging the power of
 present-day computers. In particular:
 .
  * The amount of memory we have today is in no way comparable to what Knuth
    had when he first wrote TeX in the 1970s.
  * Also, the choice of our favourite programming language is no more limited
    by "what compiles on all machines of the laboratory".
  * The global network has changed: today, nobody knows anyone on the net.
