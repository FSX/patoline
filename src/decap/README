This software depends on:
  - OCaml
  - Findlib
  - Compiler libs (only for 3.12)
  - GNU Make (install)

The following versions of OCaml are supported:
  - 3.12.1 (can be installed, but cannot be used to bootstrap)
  - 4.00.1
  - 4.01.0
  - 4.02.0 (grammar not fully implemented in pa_ocaml)

Installation procedure:
  tar -xvf decap.tar.gz
  cd decap
  make
  make
  sudo make install

Note: the "make" command needs to be run twice due to the bootstrap procedure.
