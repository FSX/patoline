This software depends on:
  - OCaml
  - Findlib
  - Compiler libs (only for 3.12)
  - GNU Make (install)

The following versions of OCaml are supported:
  - 3.12.1
  - 4.00.1
  - 4.01.0
  - 4.02.0 (grammar not fully implemented in pa_ocaml)

Remarks: 

- 3.12.1 version of OCaml does not come with the compiler-libs. Under
debian, there is a separate package, but still from .cmi are missing
and must be taken from the OCaml source tree after compilation.

- 3.12.1 and 4.00.1 version can not bootstrap using ascii ml file
(make boot), but it can bootstrap as a preprocessor. This does not
prevent to use these versions at all. This is because the
compiler-libs did not come at that time with a pretty-printer for OCaml's ast and we choose to boostrap
using ascii .ml file

Installation procedure:
  tar -xvf decap.tar.gz
  cd decap
  make
  make
  sudo make install

Note: the first "make" command will compile pa_ocaml from ascii .ml
files in boostrap/X.XX.X generated by pa_ocaml before
distribution. The second make will use the newly generated pa_ocaml
binary as a preprocessor directly. It is safe to run make only once, but the second run is a good idea to test pa_ocaml.
